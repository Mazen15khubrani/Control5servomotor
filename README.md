# Control5servomotor
This is an Arduino programming project using Arduino Uno circuit.
In this project, I used 5 servo motors and programmed and controlled them through 5 Potentiometers  for each Potentiometer  motor to move the robot arm.
I tested this project using a simulator (TinkerCad).
The motors are programmed to move between 90Â° and 180 .
